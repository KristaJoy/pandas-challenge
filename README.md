Creating summary data with a Pandas challenge project using data from the Heroes of Pymoli fantasy game.

Observations — 
After reviewing the analysis of the data we see that the majority of players for the game are male (84.03%) and most likely to between the ages of 20–24 (46.79%). The smallest segments of players were 40+ or under 10-years-old.

Of puchases made, females and other/non-disclosed persons spent a bit more per average total purchase then male. Although, of the top spenders, 4 out of 5 were male. 

The top two most popular and profitable items to buy were Final Critic, and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm.
