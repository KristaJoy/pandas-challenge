Creating summary data with a Pandas challenge project using data from the Heroes of Pymoli fantasy game.

Observations — 
After reviewing the analysis of the data we see that the majority of players for the game are male (84.03%) and most likely to between the ages of 20–24 (46.79%). Meanwhile, the smallest segments of players by age were 40+ (2.08%) players or under 10-years-old (2.95%) players.

Of puchases made, females and other/non-disclosed persons spent a bit more per average total purchase than male. Although, of the top five spenders, 4 out of 5 were male, so the majority of top spenders below that must be female. 

The top two most popular and profitable items to buy were Final Critic, and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm.
